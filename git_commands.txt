1. Go to local dir on system and right click then click "Git Bash Here"

2. To initialize
	$ git init

3. Pull: The git pull command fetches changes from a remote repository to a local repository.

	i) first, you need to set your central repository as origin using the command.
		$ git remote add origin <link of your central repository>

	ii) Now that my origin is set, let us extract files from the origin using pull.
		$ git pull origin master

	iii) One can also try pulling files from a different branch
		$ git pull origin <branch-name>

4. Get the status of local dir
	$ git status

5. Add any new or modified files to the index. this has to be done before commit.
	$ git add <directory>
		or
	$ git add <file>

Note:	$ git add -A	:to add all the files at once.

6. Commit: it only copies the changes made in the repository.

	$ git commit -m "<message>"

Note:	$ git commit -a -m "<message>"	:to commit all the files at once.

7. Creating branch: this will create the branch of master copy.
	$ git branch <branch name>

8. Branches in Git are nothing but pointers to a specific commit.
	==> local branches: 
		A local branch is just another path of your working tree.		
				
	==> remote tracking branches.
		A. They link your work from the local repository to the work on central repository.
		B. They automatically detect which remote branches to get changes from, when you use git pull.
	
	i) Checking the current branch:
		$ git branch
	
	ii) creating the new branch
		$ git branch <branch name>
	
	iii) Switching to the branch
		$ git checkout <branch_name>

	iv) create a new branch and checkout the new branch at the same time.
		$ git checkout -b[ branch_name]

9. Merging: It is the way to combine the work of different branches together. This will allow us to branch off, develop a new feature, and then combine it back in.

	$ git merge <branch_name>
Note: while merging be on the destination (ex. master)
